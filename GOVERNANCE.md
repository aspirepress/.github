# AspirePress Governance

## In General

Right now, we are working on our governance model. Please feel free to request Slack access [here](https://aspirepress.org/contact).

## Versioning

This project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) for all packages, libraries and plugins.

## Maintenance Cycle

Every major version released will be maintained, unless we mark the project as abandoned. If we mark a project as abandoned, we will grant at least six months notice prior to the end of support.

When a new major version is released, we will offer security fixes and patches to the old version for one year following the release of the new version. For example, if 1.0 is replaced by 2.0, we will continue to support 1.0 with security and patches for 1 year following the release of 2.0.

For minor and patch (<major>.<minor>.<patch>) versions, we offer no ongoing support of an old minor or patch version once a new one has come out. Because we follow semantic versioning, we will not break compatibility of the major version in a minor or patch release.

The exception to this policy is in an emergency where security or safety is at risk. If a security issue requires breaking backwards compatibility, we will a) inform users through our communication channels and b) make the minimum number of changes required to patch the problem. We may also revoke access to versions that contain severe security vulnerabilities. Finally, we will prepare to release a new major version as quickly as possible containing the breaking changes.
