# Welcome to AspirePress

[AspirePress](https://aspirepress.org) exists to promote the WordPress ecosystem, and to build WordPress into what we all aspire it to be.
                                                                                                 |
The [AspirePress Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/aspirepress/projects/6) is managed in GitHub by the AspirePress project management teaam.

## Long-term: distributed, federated, funded

The long-term goals of the project include 3 key elements:

* Fully Distributed - anyone can set up an AspirePress mirror and host WordPress assets (ie plugins and themes);
* Federated - you can join a network of mirrors to share assets between mirrors
* Funded - there be an opportunity for commercial benefit for those who host mirrors, as well as providing open source contributions to the community.

None of these concepts is particularly ground-breaking. For example, the Domain Name System (DNS) is distributed and federated. A good mirror should work like DNS: publication of a plugin to one mirror should result in propagation of that plugin to other mirrors that support it and wish to make it available.

## We need your help

This is a full-court press for the community, and it takes a lot of people to make an open source project work. We need people to contribute code and architecture to the AspirePress projects, write documentation, test and offer  feedback and critiques. We also need experts at devops, marketing, social media, and outreach to WordPress hosting and agencies to adopt AspirePress.
